I lead **life sciences sales**, working with global **pharma** and **biotech** clients to shape **data‑driven**, **AI‑enabled** solutions that improve how therapies are developed and delivered. 

In parallel, I serve as a **professor** within the **UNC system**, teaching **data science** and helping students and professionals apply modern **analytics** and **machine learning** to real‑world healthcare and business problems.

I am also an **entrepreneur**, building and advising **ventures** at the intersection of **healthcare**, **data**, and **technology**, with a focus on scalable, **patient‑centric platforms**. Over the years, I have become an **expert in AI**, especially in how **large language models**, **biomedical concepts**, and **advanced analytics** can transform **clinical trials**, **commercial models**, and **decision‑making** in life sciences.

At the same time, I remain a **hands‑on practitioner** and **sales leader**, comfortable rolling up my sleeves with **data**, **architecture**, and **product** details while also driving **executive‑level conversations**, **partnerships**, and **revenue growth**.

I love this field and love to connect with those in it! Please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn @ https://www.linkedin.com/in/sabyasachigupta/
